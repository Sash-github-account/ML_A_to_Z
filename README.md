My versions/solutions from the course:  Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science in Udemy

This repo has all of my versions of the python and R, that I created following the course lectures. These were developed using spyder IDE in 
anaconda and Rstudio. The course consists of a quick introduction to several machine learning alogrithms.
